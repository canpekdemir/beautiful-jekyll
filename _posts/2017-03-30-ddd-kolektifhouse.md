I gave my third Domain Driven Design talk at our public iyzico engineering meetup series.
The meetup was at <a href="https://www.kolektifhouse.co/">KolektifHouse</a>

The presentation had a look from a startup perspective and I mentioned about how DDD helps fast growing companies in terms of both technical and team organizations.
